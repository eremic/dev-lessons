/* You shouldn't need any additional tools for this problem.  As a brief reminder,
 * to check if a number is even, you can write:
 *
 *     if( num % 2 === 0 ){
 *     }
 *
 * The one thing that might trip you up is that you will have to swap values from one
 * variable to another, e.g.:
 *
 *     var a = 10;
 *     var b = 20;
 *
 *     a = b;
 *     // a and b are now both 20
